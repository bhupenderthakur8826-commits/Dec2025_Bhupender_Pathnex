#### Pod is NOT running in a Kubernetes cluster, use the following step-by-step troubleshooting

  →  kubectl get pods  
      → kubectl describe pod
 → kubectl logs
      → kubectl get events
→ kubectl get nodes


#### OOMKilled happens when a container exceeds its memory limit, the kernel kills it with exit code 137. We identify it using kubectl
     describe pod, check memory limits, logs, and node memory pressure, then fix by increasing memory or optimizing the app.
